# Boston AirBnB analysis Project

## Idea and Design
In this project, we will take a look at the analysis of the Airbnb dataset for Boston and take a look at what story the dataset will tell us. We will do some exploratory data analysis, and some data cleaning, and answer some questions involving

* Top and bottom listings,
* Reviewers and their rankings,
* Reviewerâ€™s general mood to check review reliability,
* The mood around listings, customer satisfaction, and positivity

## Blog post
I wrote a blog to explain the project and the questions we solved in the code, do take a look if it is something you are interested in.
